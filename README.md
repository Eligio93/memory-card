# Memory Card Game
## Description

In this project, I had to develop a memory card game. The rule of the game is not to click on a card more than once. Each time you click on a card, the score increases, also recording the best score until you click on all the cards. In that case, you win the game.

## Struggles point

I managed to develop this game without major difficulties. However, I had to use the useEffect hook in React for the first time along with an API call. I also spent a lot of time on styling the entire project, including positioning the cards and adapting the images from the API call.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed developing this game as it provided me with additional practice with React components and hooks. Furthermore, it was helpful to review API call handling. Generally, the project is quite responsive in terms of content placement, such as the positioning of the cards. However, I think I will revisit the header and footer for usability on devices with smaller screens.
